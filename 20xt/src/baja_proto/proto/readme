To compile your `.proto` files into usable C++ code, you need to use the Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`). Here's how you can do it:

1. Install protobuf compiler

```bash
sudo apt get protobuf-compiler
```

2. Open a terminal and 

3. Navigate to the directory with `.proto` file. Run the following command to generate the C++ code:

```bash
protoc --experimental_allow_proto3_optional --cpp_out=. baja_live_comm.proto
```

Remember to link against the protobuf library when compiling your program. If you're using g++, you can do this with `-lprotobuf`.
